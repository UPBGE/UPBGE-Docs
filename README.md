Welcome to the official repository of UPBGE's Manual and Python API, the UPBGE source-code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/UPBGE/blender).

You can contribute by opening an issue asking for a topic to be included in the documentation and/or opening a pull-request with the desired changes.
If you'd rather contribute several things directly ask for commit rights. 

Once a change is committed, a build is automatically generated and the new changes pushed to the [upbge-docs](https://upbge.org/docs/latest/manual) repository directly.
