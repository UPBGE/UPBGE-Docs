Constraints Actuator
********************

.. seealso::
   See the Python reference of this logic brick in :class:`SCA_ConstraintActuator`.

The *Constraints Actuator* adds a constraint to the location or orientation of an object.
This is useful for controlling the physics of the object in-game.


Properties
==========

Constraint Mode
   Constraint type to use. Each is described below.


Force Field Constraint
----------------------

Create a force field buffer zone along one axis of the object.

   Force Field Constraint.

Damping
   Damping factor of the Fh spring force.
Distance
   Height of Fh area.
Rot Fh
   Make game object axis parallel to the normal of trigger object.
Direction
   Axis in which to create force field (can be \+ or \-, or None).
Force
   Force value to be used.
N
   When on, use a horizontal spring force on slopes.
M/P
   Trigger on another Object will be either Material (M) or Property (P).
Property
   Property/Material that triggers the Force Field constraint (blank for **all** Properties/Materials).
Per
   Persistence button: When on, force field constraint always looks at Property/Material; when off, turns itself off if it cannot find the Property/Material.
Time
   Number of frames for which constraint remains active.
RotDamp
   Damping factor for rotation.


Orientation Constraint
----------------------

Constrain the specified axis in the Game to a specified direction in the World axis.

   Orientation Constraint.

Direction
   Game axis to be modified (X, Y, Z or none).
Damping
   Delay (frames) of the constraint response.
Time
   Time (frames) for the constraint to remain active.
Reference Direction
   Reference direction (global coordinates) for the specified game axis.
Min Angle
   Minimum angle for the axis modification.
Max Angle
   Maximum angle for the axis modification.


Distance Constraint
-------------------

Maintain the distance the Game Object has to be from a surface.

   :width: 271px

   Distance Constraint.

Direction
   Axis Direction (X, Y, Z, -X, -Y, -Z, or None).
L
   If on, use local axis (otherwise use World axis).
N
   If on, orient the Game Object axis with the mesh normal.
Range
   Maximum length of ray used to check for Material/Property on another game object.
Force Distance
   Distance to be maintained between object and
   the Material/Property that triggers the *Distance Constraint*.
Damping
   Delay (frames) of the constraint response.
M/P
   Trigger on another Object will be either Material (M) or Property (P).
Property
   Property/Material that triggers the Distance Constraint (blank for **all** Properties/Materials)
Per
   Persistence button: When on, Distance Constraint always looks for Property/Material; when off, turns itself off if it cannot find the Property/Material.
Time
   Number of frames for which constraint remains active.
Rotation Damping
   Damping factor for rotation.


Location Constraint
-------------------

Limit the position of the Game Object within one World Axis direction.
To limit movement within an area or volume, use two or three constraints.

   Location Constraint.

Limit
   Axis in which to apply limits (LocX, LocY, LocZ or none).
Min
   Minimum limit in specified axis (Blender Units).
Max
   Maximum limit in specified axis (Blender Units).
Damping
   Delay (frames) of the constraint.
