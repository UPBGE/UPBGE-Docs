.. seealso::
   See the Python reference of this logic brick in :class:`SCA_StateActuator`.

The *State Actuator* allows the user to create complex logic,
while retaining a clear user interface. It does this by having different states,
and performing operations upon them.

.. note::

   With the state actuator, you can create tiers of logic,
   without the need for hundreds of properties. Use it well, and you benefit greatly,
   but often problems may be circumvented by Python.
