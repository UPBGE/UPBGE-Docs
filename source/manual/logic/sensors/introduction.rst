Introduction
************

Sensors are the logic bricks that cause the logic to do anything.
Sensors give an output when something happens, e.g.
a trigger event such as a collision between two objects, a key pressed on the keyboard,
or a timer for a timed event going off. When a sensor is triggered,
a positive pulse is sent to all controllers that are linked to it.

The logic blocks for all types of sensor may be constructed and changed using
the Logic Editor; details of this process are given
in the :doc:`Sensor Editing </manual/logic/sensors/editing>` page.

Common Options
==============

   Common Sensor options.

All sensors have a set of common buttons, fields and menus. They are organized as follows:

Triangle button |down-button|
   Collapses the sensor information to a single line (toggle).
Sensor type menu
   Specifies the type of the sensor.
Sensor name
   The name of the sensor. This can be selected by the user. It is used to access sensors with Python;
   it needs to be unique among the selected objects.
Pin button |pin-button|
   Display the sensor even when it is not linked to a visible states controller.
Movement buttons |movement-button|
   Move the sensor up or down over other sensors within the column.
Checkbox button
   When unchecked the sensor is deactivated, no pulses will be sent to the connected
   controllers. Very useful to check different logics without unlink or delete the sensor.
``X`` button
   Deletes the sensor.

.. note:: Triggers

   If a controller does not get triggered by any connected sensor
   (regardless of the sensors' state) it will not be activated at all.

   A sensor triggers the connected controllers on state change.
   When the sensor changes its state from negative to positive or positive to negative,
   the sensor triggers the connected controllers.
   A sensor triggers a connected controller as well when the sensor changes from deactivation to
   activation.

The following parameters specify how the sensor triggers connected controllers:

True level triggering |true-button|
   If this is set, the connected controllers will be triggered as long as the sensor's state is positive.
   The sensor will trigger skipping the logic ticks (See parameter: Skip) indicated in the sensor.
False level triggering |false-button|
   If this is set, the connected controllers will be triggered as long as the sensor's state is negative.
   The sensor will trigger skipping the logic ticks (See parameter: Skip) indicated in the sensor.
Skip
   This parameter sets the number of logic ticks skipped between 2 active pulses or triggers.
   The default value is 0 and it means no logic tick is skipped.
   It is only used if at least one of the level triggering parameters are enabled.

   Raising the value of *Skip* is a good way for saving performance costs by avoiding
   to execute controllers or activate actuators more often than necessary.

   Examples: (assuming the default frame rate with a frequency of 60 Hz (60 frames per second)).

*Level* Button
   Triggers connected controllers when state (of the build-in state machine) changes
   (for more information see :doc:`States </manual/logic/states>`).

The following parameters specify how the sensor's status gets evaluated:

*Tap* Button
   Changes the sensor's state to negative one frame after changing
   to positive even if the sensor evaluation remains positive.
   As this is a state change it triggers the connected controllers as well.
   Only one of *Tap* or *Level* can be activated.
   If the *TRUE level triggering* is set,
   the sensor state will consecutive change from True to False until the sensor evaluates False.
   The *FALSE level triggering* will be ignored when the *Tap* parameter is set.

*Invert* Button
   This inverts the sensor output.
   If this is set, the sensor's state will be inverted.
   This means the sensor's state changes to positive when evaluating False and changes to
   False when evaluating True.
   If the *Tap* parameter is set, the sensor triggers the controller based on the inverted sensor state.
