Ray Sensor
==============================

.. seealso::
   See the Python reference of this logic brick in :class:`SCA_RaySensor`.

The *Ray Sensor* shoots a ray in the direction of an axis and sends a positive pulse once it hits something. It can be filtered to only detect objects with a given material or property.

Properties

See :ref:`Sensor Common Options <game-engine-logic-sensors-common-options>` for common options.

Property
   This field can be used to limit the sensor to look for only those objects with this property.

.. note::
   -  Unless the Property field is set, the Ray sensor can detect objects "through" other objects (walls, etc.).
   -  Objects must have Physics "Actor" property enabled to be detected.

Axis
   This menu determines the direction of the ray. The Â± signs is whether it is on the axis direction (+), or the opposite (-).

Range
   Determines the length of the ray (in Blender units).

X-Ray Mode button
   Makes it x-ray, so that it sees through objects that do not have the property or material specified in the filter field.
