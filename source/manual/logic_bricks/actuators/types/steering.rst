Steering Actuator
==============================

.. seealso::
   See the Python reference of this logic brick in :class:`SCA_SteeringActuator`.

The *Steering Actuator* provides simple pathfinding for an object by moving it towards a target object, with options to seek, flee, or follow a path. This actuator will not actually try to avoid obstacles by deviating the objects course.

   Steering Actuator

Properties
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Behavior
   Seek, Flee or Path following
Target Object
   The game object to seek.

Navigation Mesh Object
   The name of the navigation mesh object used by the Steering Actuator when in Path following behavior. The game object will use the Navigation Mesh to create a path to follow the Target Object.

   .. tip::
      You can create your own mesh to use for navigation and make it a Navigation Mesh in: :menuselection:`Properties editor > Physics > Physics panel > choosing Physics Type: Navigation Mesh` Or you can let Blender create a Navigation Mesh, then select a mesh. (Floor, or ground, or etc.): :menuselection:`Properties editor > Scene > Navigation mesh object panel > Build navigation mesh`

Distance
   The maximum distance for the game object approach the Target Object.
Velocity
   The velocity used to seek the Target Object.
Acceleration
   The maximum acceleration to use when seeking the Target Object.
Turn Speed
   The maximum turning speed to use when seeking the Target Object.
Facing
   Set a game object axis that always faces the Target Object.
Axis
   The game object axis that always faces the Target Object. Options are: Positive (``X``, ``Y``, ``Z``) and Negative (``-X``, ``-Y``, ``-Z``).
Axis N
   Use the Normal of the Navigation Mesh to align the up vector of the game object.
Self Terminated
   If disabled:
      Stops moving toward the Target Object once it reaches the maximum distance to approach the Target Object. Will follow the Target Object if it moves further away than the maximum distance.
   If enabled:
      Stops moving toward the Target Object once it reaches the maximum distance to approach the Target Object. Will not follow even if the Target Object moves further away than the maximum distance.
Lock ``Z`` velocity
   Avoid object movement in ``Z`` axis while seeking a target.
Visualize
   This checkbox let the user specify whether to show or not the debug informations of the actuator. It only available for *Path following* behaviour.
Update period
   Set the period to update path detection. It only available for *Path following* behaviour.
